To create a MongoDB database and a user using mongosh in Ubuntu, follow these steps:

Step 1: Start the MongoDB Shell (mongosh)

Open a terminal and run:

mongosh

Step 2: Create a New Database

MongoDB creates a database automatically when you switch to a non-existent database and insert data. Use the use command:

use mydatabase


Replace mydatabase with your preferred database name.

Step 3: Create a User

Create a user with a username, password, and assigned roles:

db.createUser({
  user: "myuser",
  pwd: "mypassword",
  roles: [{ role: "readWrite", db: "mydatabase" }]
})

	•	Replace "myuser" with your desired username.
	•	Replace "mypassword" with a secure password.
	•	The readWrite role allows the user to read and write data in mydatabase.

Step 4: Exit the Shell

exit

Step 5: Enable Authentication (Optional but Recommended)

Edit the MongoDB configuration file to enable authentication:

sudo nano /etc/mongod.conf

Find the security section and add:

security:
  authorization: enabled

Save the file (Ctrl + X, then Y, then Enter) and restart MongoDB:

sudo systemctl restart mongod

Step 6: Connect with the New User

Now, connect to MongoDB using authentication:

mongosh -u myuser -p mypassword --authenticationDatabase mydatabase

This ensures that the user has proper access.

You’re all set! Let me know if you run into any issues.
